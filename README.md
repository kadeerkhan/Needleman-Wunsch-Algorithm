# Needleman-Wunsch-Algorithm

* Implemented in C++ in Visual Studio 19

This algorithm is an application of Dynamic programming

The Needlemanâ€“Wunsch algorithm is an algorithm used in bioinformatics to align protein or nucleotide sequences. It was one of the first applications of dynamic programming to compare biological sequences. The algorithm was developed by Saul B. Needleman and Christian D. Wunsch and published in 1970.

Meanwhile i have used it here to match 2 song notes. for the ease of understanding, i have used alphabetic letters as song notes but the code is generic and can work for any given txt files. 

I have attached a c++ file. no additional code is required. The program asks the user to enter 2 song files in txt format. The program tells the similarity index between the two songs and the number of possible allignements.

The test files and their output files are added along with the code.
